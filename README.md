# object_localization_pipeline

Combines a couple of algorithms to provide object detection and localization.

In particular, this package calls and provides vision utilities to support using the UR5 with the "lcsr_assembly" structure construction task. There are a few differente launch files supporting different versions of the Object RANSAC algorithm for estimating object poses.

Still under development.
